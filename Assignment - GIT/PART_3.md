# Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts


1. Fetch the Latest Changes from Remote:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Merge the Branches:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

3. Identify Conflicted Files:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

4. Open and Resolve Conflicted Files:
   Open each conflicted file in a text editor and look for conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>). Edit the files to resolve the conflicts by deciding which changes to keep.
   ```bash
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   This is content from the master branch.
   =======
   This is content from the feature branch.
   >>>>>>> feature-branch
   ```
   Remove the conflict markers and make necessary changes to resolve the conflicts.


5. Mark the Conflicts as Resolved:
   ```bash
   git add <conflicted-file>
   ```
   Repeat this for each conflicted file.

6. Commit the Merge:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

7. Push the Changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

8. Create a Pull Request
Go to your remote repository on GitHub and create a pull request to merge the new-feature branch into the master branch.

9. Merge the Pull Request
Once the pull request is created, review the changes and merge it into the master branch.

10. Complete sequence of the commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin URL_OF_YOUR_REMOTE_REPOSITORY
   git checkout -b new-feature
   echo "Hello, World!" > example.txt
   git add example.txt
   git commit -m "Add example.txt with initial content"
   git push -u origin new-feature
   ```
